# [Tiny API](https://tiny-api.dev) - A Tiny API To Make Tiny APIs
![Website Preview](https://github.com/cameronhh/tiny-api/blob/master/.github/repo-image.png)

- *Quickly prototyping some front-end code and need a couple of endpoints to return some static JSON?*
- *Perhaps you're integrating a front-end with a back-end that doesn't have a test server?*
- ***Make an endpoint that returns static JSON in seconds with [Tiny API](https://tiny-api.dev)***


This repo is the front end code for [tiny-api.dev](https://tiny-api.dev). The Tiny API website was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The code for the front end can be found [here](https://github.com/cameronhh/tiny-api-client).
